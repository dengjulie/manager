we want to preload the data that employeecreate shows
bootstrap the form, inject our employee into it

creating vs editing the form - some minor differences
a lot of conditional logic
decision to reuse code ...
common thing to consider

PREPOPULATE state in form reducer
also make sure we do not edit the data from memory. in case they don't save.

refactor! separate out the reusable code

<EmployeeForm {...this.props} />
** forward all props!
