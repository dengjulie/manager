we want to preload the data that employeecreate shows
bootstrap the form, inject our employee into it

creating vs editing the form - some minor differences
a lot of conditional logic
decision to reuse code ...
common thing to consider

PREPOPULATE state in form reducer
also make sure we do not edit the data from memory. in case they don't save.

refactor! separate out the reusable code

<EmployeeForm {...this.props} />
** forward all props!

use lodash because we are going to iterate over all the properties of the employee
componentWillMount() {
  _.each(this.props.employee, (value, prop) => { // understand there is an employee model coming into the component, iterate over every property on that object
    this.props.employeeUpdate({ prop, value }); // and update our reducer with every property
  });
}
other approach: action creator to accept multiple values

** we did not push anything to firebase in these steps so that we do not do anything until the save button is hit

SET property of firebase.auth()
trying to update a very specific record so $uid at end
firebase.database().ref(`/users/${currentUser.uid}/employees/${uid}`)
  .set({ name, phone, shift })
  .then

***remember the props u have for classes

remember that firebase only updates the form because of the watcher .on('value') function!
